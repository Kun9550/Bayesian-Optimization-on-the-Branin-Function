**Apply Bayesian optimization on a classical function called Branin function:** 

The details of this function can be found at: https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/branin.html

We showed the optimization procedure with PI and EI acquisition functions respectively, as detailed in the Brainin_BO.ipynb file.
